# BGP Conditional Advertisement
This features allows for advertisement of routes to other neighbours only when a specific condition is met. Particularly by checking the existence of another prefix in the BGP RIB such that the advertisement of a specific prefix or set of prefixes depends on the existence or inexistence of another prefix in the bgp table.

## Objective
AS64513 is the source of the prefix 172.31/16 which it announce to its two peers in AS64512 and AS64515 who in turn announce it to AS64516. AS64516 itself is a source of two prefixes 10.1.1/24 and 172.18.0/24. The objective is to have AS64516 announce the prefix 10.1.1/24 to AS64515 only when AS64515 announces the prefix 172.31/16 (from AS64513) to AS64516. When AS64515 is not advertising 172.31/16 to AS64516, AS64516 should stop advertising its prefix 10.1.1/24 to AS64515 while still advertising the other prefixes (except 10.1.1/24) to AS64515 as well as advertising 10.1.1/24 and other prefixes to AS64512.

The route-maps applied tell the router to use ` MAP_AS64515_CONDITIONAL_OUT ` only when the conditions in ` MAP_AS64513_FROM_AS64515 ` are satisfied if the conditions are not satisfied it does the opposite of what is specified in ` MAP_AS64515_CONDITIONAL_OUT ` which in this case the opposite of ` MAP_AS64515_CONDITIONAL_OUT ` is to deny prefixes from prefix-list ` PL_AS64516` since the route map ` MAP_AS64515_CONDITIONAL_OUT ` does not have any other entries the implicit deny in the end of the route-map turns to allow all that is not matched with the prefix-list ` PL_AS64516`

The configuration on the other routers is just standard BGP stuff.
